MongoDB Sharding:

Sharding is used to handle large datasets by distributing them across multiple servers (shards).
It improves read/write scalability.

Steps:
1. Enable sharding on DB: sh.enableSharding("mydb")
2. Shard a collection: sh.shardCollection("mydb.mycollection", { _id: "hashed" })
